# Todo App created using React, Axios
Hi there! You can look my clear code, and how i use React hooks and Class Components.
# Functionality
You can:
* Add task[they saving in local storage]
* Edit task and save him[the task will also change in your local storage]
* Delete task from the interface and local storage
* Task filter, you can search for the tasks you need by their name[For example: you have more tasks "buy a laptop, do math itc", and you can write "buy" - answer will be your task with the word "buy a laptop". The filter works on your typed letters]
* Change theme on light or dark. I was maked positive colors for people, who like light theme or who like dark theme. Change button is in header, with beautifully designed.
* Login and Register fields. Login and Register have validation logic, schemas i put in a separate component. Logic [For Example: Full Name must have minimum 3 characters,
Password must be:
  The password must start at the beginning of the line.
  The password must contain at least one digit.
  The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
  The password must contain at least one capital letter.
  The password must be at least 5 characters long.]
* Calendar. It works, but we don't have his condition, so we cannot use him with our tasks.
